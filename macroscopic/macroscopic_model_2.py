This code estimates parameters to model the cage dwell times using maximum likelihood.
We start with estimating parameters for phase A. After this we will consider phases B and C and potential changes to the model.
Work in progress.

The model is a drift-diffusion model where a dynamic energy landscape determines transition probabilities.
